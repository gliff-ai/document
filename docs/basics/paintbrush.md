# Paintbrush

One of the the most commonly used annotation methods, the gliff.ai platform contains multiple paintbrush features for easy markup of images.

![Paintbrush Functions](/img/annotate/annotate_paintbrush.png)

_Tip: To begin a new annotation or to cycle back through annotations already completed, please see the Annotation management section of [Annotation: First Steps](firststeps)._

## Brush

By clicking the **Paintbrush** button, you will reveal the paintbrush tool interface.
Clicking the next **Paintbrush** button revealed will cause the size slider to appear, allowing the radius of the brush to be altered within a range of 1 pixel to 40 pixels.
Once selected, you can draw anywhere on the canvas with a circular annotation of the size selected.

If you have created a solid outline, continuous annotation using the paintbrush, you can fill the shape created using the **Fill Active Paintbrush** button.

## Eraser

By clicking the **Eraser** button you can switch the brush tool to erase sections of the current annotation.
You will again be given the size slider to choose your size, as with the brush.
Erasing on the canvas works identically to the brush.

## 3D Brush

_Tip: The 3D brush will only work with multi-slice (z stack-style) images._

Clicking the **Use 3D brushstrokes** button will activate the 3D brush, 3D annotations are rendered as a sphere with the widest part on the current slice. The 2D tools (above) can be used to modify the annotation on specific slides.

## Transparency

The transparency of active and non-active annotations can be altered by clicking the **Annotation Transparency** button.
Using the two sliders allows you to modify the transparency of both the current (brush) and all other (brush) annotations in the range of 0-100% (opacity).
This can be a very useful tool to determine the accuracy of drawn annotations by comparing to the background image.

## Strokes vs. Pixels

Brush strokes can be converted from the standard vector-graphic representation into pixel level annotations, based on the size of the pixels of the image being annotated.

To convert, click the **Show strokes as pixels** button.
