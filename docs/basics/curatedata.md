# Curating a Dataset

The principal curation interface includes a lot of tools to assist with parsing and analysing a dataset.

Tip: In order to access the curation interface, you must first setup a project ([Create a Project](../introduction/createproject))

## Size and Select

The thumbnail size selector panel allows the user to easily alter the image previews to suit requirements.

![Thumbnail Size and Multiple Image Selection Tools](/img/curate/curate_size.png)
Click the **Large Thumbnails**, **Medium Thumbnails** or **Small Thumbnails** button to switch between views.

Clicking on a image preview will highlight the selected image and display the metadata for that image.
Selecting multiple images using standard **Shift + Click** or **CTRL + Click** functions and then clicking the **Select Multiple Images** button will reveal a new panel summarising image numbers and the **Delete Images** button.

Double-clicking on any image will take you through to the **Annotate** interface for image markup.

## Sort

gliff.ai provides a full metadata sort functionality.

![Metadata Sort Interface](/img/curate/curate_sort.png)

Clicking the **Sort** button reveals the sort panel.
By selecting a given image characteristic from the dropdown menu (e.g. Name, Size) and selecting the sort type (**ASC** or **DESC**) the sort can be applied by clicking the **Sort** button.

## Search

If desired, you can also use gliff.ai to search through the image metadata.

![Metadata Search Interface](/img/curate/curate_search.png)

Images can be searched for using any image characteristic or label.
Clicking the **Search Category** dropdown will allow you to select an image characteristic or label to search.
Clicking the **...** textbox you can type a search term or select from suggested search terms.
Clicking the **Search** button will apply the search.

## Collections

If you have access to multiple collections, these can be viewed by clicking the **View Collection** button.

Changes to the current collection are saved automatically as they are made.
