# Curating a Dataset

The principal curation interface includes a lot of tools to assist with parsing and analysing a dataset.

Tip: In order to access the curation interface, you must first setup a project ([Create a Project](../getstarted/createproject))

## Size and Select

The thumbnail size selector panel allows the user to easily alter the image previews to suit requirements.
Click the **Large Thumbnails**, **Medium Thumbnails** or **Small Thumbnails** button to switch between views.

Clicking on a image preview will highlight the selected image and display the metadata for that image.
Selecting multiple images using standard **Shift + Click** or **CTRL + Click** functions and then clicking the **Select Multiple Images** button will reveal a new panel summarising image numbers and the **Delete Images** button.

Double-clicking on any image will take you through to the **Annotate** interface for image markup.

## Sort

## Search
