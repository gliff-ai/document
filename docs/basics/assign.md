# Assigning Images

There are two methods to assign collaborators to specific images with Curate: Manual and Auto-assign.

Tip: In order to be able to assign team members and collaborators to images, you must have images uploaded to the platform ([Create a Project](/createproject)) and have collaborators invited to the platform and added to the project ([Adding Users](/adduser)).

## Auto-assign

![Auto-assign Button](/img/curate/curate_auto.png)

If you only wish to assign some of the images within the collection, select them using the **Select Multiple Images** button.
To initiate an auto-assign, click the **Auto Assign** button.

![Auto-assign Pop-up for New Assignment](/img/curate/curate_auto_new.png)

A pop-up will appear, you can choose whether to assign all images within the collection or just the currently selected images using the drop-down.
You can also select the number of people assigned to each image.
Once complete, click the **assign** button

![Auto-assign Pop-Up for Existing Assignment](/img/curate/curate_auto_existing.png)

If some of the images have been assigned previously, you will be presented with a warning and an additional drop-down to decide if you want to perform a **new** assignment, which will overwrite previous assignments, or an **integrative** assignment, which will leave previous assignments, but take them into account so that, overall, the number of images assigned to each user remains evenly distributed.

If the image selection is not able to be assigned in a balanced way, you will receive an error message and will need to alter assignment settings in order to continue.

## Manual Assignment

![Update Assignees Button](/img/curate/curate_assignees.png)

To manually assign images, first select the desired images using the **Select Multiple Images** button.
Click the **Update Assignees** button.

![Manual Assignment Pop-Up](/img/curate/curate_manual.png)

A pop-up will appear where you can select users by name to be added or removed as an assignee to the selected images.
Click **Assign** when finished.
