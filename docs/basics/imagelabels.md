# Label Images

Every image can be individually labelled by clicking the **Update image labels** flag on the desired image.

![Update Image Label Button](/img/curate/curate_update_label.png)

This will open the label panel for the clicked image.

![Image Label Pop-Up](/img/curate/curate_label.png)

A Label can be added to the image by typing in the **New Label** textbox and clicking the **+** button.
Alternatively, if default labels are active, a Label dropdown will appear, allowing you to select between the default labels that have been allocated.
The labels attached to a given image are shown at the button of the panel and can be removed by clicking the **x** button next to a particular label.

All labels used on the image collection can be viewed in the **Annotation Labels** dropdown.
Using the arrows next to the labels, and the **Select all labels** or **Deselect all labels** button, single or multiple labels can be selected (denoted by a **Green** arrow).
Only images that have all the selected labels will be shown.
Additionally, all unlabelled images can be displayed using the **Select all unlabelled images** button.

Tip: Labelling can be customised with default labels, read about how to setup default labels [here](../misc/defaultlabels)
