# Annotation

## First Steps

Welcome to the gliff.ai annotation tool, this has been designed to make it easy for domain-specific experts to add data to images enabling machine learning training.
Our custom browser-based UI is designed with this in mind, hopefully making the process easily accessible to annotators of all technical experience levels.

_Tip: To begin annotating an image, double click on the desired image in the curate interface. To learn more about this interface, please see [Curate a Dataset](curatedata). If you cannot see the image you are looking for, it is possible you are not assigned to the image, please contact one of your team members to alter the assignment._

## Annotation Management

![Controls for the Management of Annotations](/img/annotate/annotate_management.png)

To begin annotating an object click the **Add New Annotation** button and select the desired functionality (see options in [Basics](thebasics)).
To delete the current annotation in progress, click the **Clear Annotation** button.
To select a different annotation click the **Select** button, click an area of the desired annotation and select the desired functionality to alter.
To undo the last action, click the **Undo last action** and to redo the action, click the **Redo last action**.

Once annotations have been completed, click the **Save Annotations** button to confirm your changes.
Please note: if you leave annotate without saving then your annotations will not be added to the image metadata.

To scroll through the annotations assigned to you, please use the arrows at the top of the page.
Please note: if you switch images without saving, you will lose and unsaved annotations.

Zoom level is controlled by the **Zoom In** and **Zoom Out** buttons.
When zoomed in, the portion of the image shown on screen is indicated by the viewfinder in the top right corner.

### Viewfinder

The viewfinder allows you to navigate and pan across an image whilst zoomed in.
The white rectangle overlay shows the currently displayed area of the main image.
Click and drag inside the white rectangle to pan across the zoomed image and view a different area.
