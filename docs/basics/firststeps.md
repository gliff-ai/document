# Annotation

## First Steps

Welcome to the gliff.ai annotation tool, this has been designed to make it easy for domain-specific experts to add data to images enabling machine learning training.
Our custom browser-based UI is designed with this in mind, hopefully making the process easily accessible to annotators of all technical experience levels.

_Tip: To begin annotating an image, double click on the desired image in the curate interface. To learn more about this interface, please see [Curate a Dataset](curatedata). If you cannot see the image you are looking for, it is possible you are not assigned to the image, please contact one of your team members to alter the assignment._

## Annotation Management

Once annotations have been completed, click the **Mark Annotation As Complete** button.
This will mark the image as complete for the team members, who can track progress on the **Manage** page.
