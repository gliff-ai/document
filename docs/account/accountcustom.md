# Account and Customisation

## Account

All users can manage their account settings within the platform.
Additionally, Team Owners can manage plan and any add ons.
Click on the circle in the top right corner of the screen that contains your user initials.

Clicking on **Account Settings** will reveal your settings, including username and email.
This is also where you can change your password.
Your team's storage usage will be revealed here also if you have permissions.

## Billing

Clicking on Bill will allow the Team owner to access details of their plan, usage, invoices and payment details.
Additionally, by clicking the **+** in the top right of the Plan Usage panel, further add ons (such as additional collaborators or storage) can be directly requested.

## Plug-ins and Custom Code

The platform is capable of integrating custom code that is specific to your team and, as with the whole platform, only visible to your team.
This works through an API/SDK connection and can be used to affect or analyse images at multiple levels within the platform.
If you wish to take advantage of this facility please contact us [contact us](https://gliff.ai/contact).
