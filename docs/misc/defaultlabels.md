# Default Labels

Default labels allow team members to pre-load a number of labels in order to simplify the labelling process.

To setup default labels, open **Curate** for the relevant project.

![Default Label Pop-Up]

Click the **Set default labels** button and a pop-up should appear.
By typing in the **New label** box and clicking **+** you can add as many default labels as desired.
You can then decide, using the check boxes, whether to restrict collaborators (including all active users) to just these labels and whether to allow multiple labels per image.
Once you have the settings desired, click the **Confirm** button to apply the changes.

_Please Note: In the current version, default labels apply universally to Curate and Annotate._
