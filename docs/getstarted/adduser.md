# Adding Users

Tip: In order for additional users (team members or collaborators) to access your project(s), they must be invited to the platform and assigned to projects and images.

## User Categories

In gliff.ai we have 3 user categories that define the level of access to data and the level of data control and user management that is permitted to an individual.
These are: _Team Owners, Team Members_ and _Collaborators_.

Team Owners have full access and control.

Team Members cannot see or update billing, but can:

- Create, delete and modify projects
- Upload new data
- Create annotations
- See a project audit (plan dependent)

Collaborators can only create annotations on images assigned to them, so these slots are useful for domain experts with specific knowledge that is useful for image analysis or machine learning.

## Invite Users

To invite a _Team Member_ or _Collaborator_, go to **Manage** and click the **Team** button or the **Collaborators** button to access the respective management pages.

Tip: Ensure that you are on the right management page (either **Team** or **Collaborators**) before inviting someone to join that user category.

On each page is list of access and control for the user category as above.
To invite someone to the platform, type their email address into the **invites** section and click the **Send** arrow.
They should then receive an invite email with a link for them to sign up with.
If they need any help, point them to the [Account Setup](setup) page of this guide.
