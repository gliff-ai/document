# Create a Project

Tip: In order to begin uploading data and annotating images, you must first create a project as described below.

![Project Management Page](/img/manage/manage_projects.png)

In the **Manage** area, click the **Projects** button to access the project management page.
To create a new project, click **+** (Add New Project).
A pop-up will appear where you can then give the project a name and assign team members already on the system to that project.
Please note: the number of projects you can create is limited by your account plan.

A project can be opened either to the Curate interface, by clicking the **Open X in Curate** button, or to the Audit interface, by clicking the **Open X in Audit** button.

## Adding Data

Now that a project has been created, you can begin to upload data.

![Project Management Page](/img/manage/manage_projects.png)

Open the project by clicking the specific **Open X in Curate** button for the desired project.
This will load the Curate interface where you can begin uploading images.

![Curate Upload Box]()

In Curate, click the **Upload Image** button.
This will open the standard file navigation pop-up for your system.
Navigate to the desired image(s) and select all those for upload.

Click the **Open** (or equivalent) button to begin the upload.

![Progress Bar]()

A progress bar will appear at the bottom of the screen.
Upload may take longer than other data transfers as the images are being encrypted during upload.
Once it reaches 100% the images will appear in the platform.

To access the image annotation interface, double click on the desired image.
