üëã **Welcome in!** üëã

This repository contains the Open Source code for [gliff.ai](https://gliff.ai)‚Äôs DOCUMENT supporting library (built using the [Just The Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) Jekyll template). 

DOCUMENT is [gliff.ai](https://gliff.ai)'s user documentation for supporting use of our user-friendly interface for curating, annotation and collaborating with imaging datasets for the purposes of developing imaging AI products. When the full [gliff.ai platform](https://gliff.ai/software/) is used, DOCUMENT provides a clear guide for our users to support the development of high-quality and auditable datasets that satisfy any relevant regulatory frameworks which enables our users to build world-changing and trustworthy AI models and products.

A preview build of the current `main` branch is [here](https://docs.gliff.app/).

‚úÖ **We welcome contributions on this repository!** ‚úÖ

## Installation

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)

Initially you will need to install [Ruby <2.7](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and [bundler](https://bundler.io/) with `gem install bundler`.

Run `bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'` to make the bundle install everything locally (so no sudo is required) and install dependenies locally with `bundle install` and npm dependencies for lint and format with `npm i`.

## Development

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)

Frontend code should always be written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and transpiled using the options in `tsconfig.json` in this repository. npm should always be used for package management.

Run `bundle exec jekyll serve -H 127.0.0.1` to get local access. Next, head to [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/) and then hit `ctrl`+`c` to stop the server.

Don't forget to regulary update dependenies with `bundle update` and `npm update`.

## Linting and Formatting

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)

As a standard, all code contributions should be linted with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) using `.eslintrc.js` and formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). **Note:** HTML + CSS, mark-up and mark-down code are exemptions and should be formatted using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) but do not need to be linted.

`npm run lint` will lint the codebase.
`npm run format` will format the codebase.

Our GitHub Actions will also lint any pull requests before they're merged.

## Testing

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)

All code contributions should be tested using both the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

`npm run test` will run any existing tests in our codebase.

Our GitHub Actions will also test any pull requests before they're merged! These all must pass and have 2 reviewers approval before a pull request can merge. If one or a few fail and your troubleshooting is not giving an answer, please check out the [gliff.ai Contribution Guide](https://github.com/gliff-ai/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) üëã for further guidance.

## Continuous Integration

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)
