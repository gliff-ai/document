üëã **Welcome in!** üëã

This repository contains the Open Source code for [gliff.ai](https://gliff.ai)‚Äôs DOCUMENT supporting library (built using the [Just The Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) Jekyll template).

DOCUMENT is [gliff.ai](https://gliff.ai)'s user documentation for supporting use of our user-friendly interface for curating, annotation and collaborating with imaging datasets for the purposes of developing imaging AI products. When the full [gliff.ai platform](https://gliff.ai/software/) is used, DOCUMENT provides a clear guide for our users to support the development of high-quality and auditable datasets that satisfy any relevant regulatory frameworks which enables our users to build world-changing and trustworthy AI models and products.

A preview build of the current `main` branch is [here](https://docs.gliff.app/).

## Installation

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)

install npm dependencies for lint and format with `npm i --include=dev`.

For further info on npm, please visit https://www.npmjs.com/.

## Development

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)

npm should always be used for package management.

Run npm run start to get local access. Next, head to [http://127.0.0.1:3000/](http://127.0.0.1:3000/) and then hit `ctrl`+`c` to stop the server.

Don't forget to regulary update dependenies with `bundle update` and `npm update`.

## Linting and Formatting

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)

**Note:** HTML + CSS, mark-up and mark-down code should be formatted using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) but do not need to be linted.

We recommend that you use globbing to lint all markdown files in the project. To do this, please replace the line "lint:md" in the package.json file with "lint:md": "npx markdownlint-cli --ignore node_modules ./*/.md".

`npm run lint` will lint the codebase.
`npm run format` will format the codebase.

Our GitHub Actions will also lint any pull requests before they're merged.

## Build Testing

Once code alterations have been made, please ensure the validity and stability of the code. We recommend using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) using command 'npm run build' or 'npm run start' for continuous visualisation.

## Continuous Integration

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)

GitHub Actions should only be included under the `.github/workflows` path.
