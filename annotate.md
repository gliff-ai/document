## Introduction

Welcome to the gliff.ai annotation tool, this has been desgined to make it easy for domain-specific experts to add data to images enabling machine learning training. Our custom browser-based UI is designed with this in mind, hopefully making the process easily acessible to annotators of all technical experience levels. Please see below for detailed instructions on how to use the software.

## Load Images

You can also quickly zoom in and out using the mouse wheel. When you zoom in, the portion of the image shown on screen is indicated by the viewfinder in the top right corner.
