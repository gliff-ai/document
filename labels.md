# Labels

_Tip: To Label and annotation you must first select it, see Annotation Management section of [Annotation: First Steps](/firststeps) for further instructions._

![Annotation Labels Interface](/assets/images/annotate/annotate_labels.png)

Any selected annotation can be labelled using the **Annotation Label** panel.
Once open, a new label can be created by typing in the **New Label** text field and clicking the **+**.
The label will be automatically applied to the annotation (denoted by green highlight).
Once multiple labels have been created, they can be toggled on and off for a selected annotation using the **+** and **X** arrow next to the desired label.

When multiple annotations are being labelled, the label panel can be pinned open (using the pin symbol, top right of the panel), otherwise the panel will close upon the next click outside the label panel.
