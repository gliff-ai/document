# Assigning Images

There are two methods to assign collaborators to specific images with Curate: Manual and Auto-assign.

Tip: In order to be able to assign collaborators to images, you must have images uploaded to the platform ([Create a Project](/createproject)) and have collaborators invited to the platform and added to the project ([Adding Users](/adduser)).

## Auto-assign

If you only wish to assign some of the images within the collection, select them using the **Select Multiple Images** button.
To initiate an auto-assign, click the **Auto Assign** button.

![Auto-assign Pop-up for New Assignment](/assets/images/curate/curate_auto_new.png)

A pop-up will appear, you can choose whether to assign all images within the collection or just the currently selected images using the drop-down.
You can also select the number of people assigned to each image, so multiple users can annotate a single image for comparison.
Once complete, click the **assign** button

![Auto-assign Pop-Up for Existing Assignment](/assets/images/curate/curate_auto_existing.png)

If some of the images have been assigned previously, you will be presented with a warning and an additional drop-down to decide if you want to perform a **new** assignment, which will overwrite previous assignments, or an **integrative** assignment, which will leave previous assignments, but take them into account for the balance of assignments to new images.

If the image selection is not able to be assigned in a balanced way, you will receive an error message and will need to alter assignment settings in order to continue.

## Manual Assignment

To manually assign images, first select the desired images using the **Select Multiple Images** button.
Click the **Update Assignees** button.

A pop-up will appear where you can select users by name to be added or removed as an assignee to the selected images.
Click **Assign** when finished.
