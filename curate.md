## Label

Every image can be individually labelled by click the **Update image labels** flag on the desired image. This will open the label panel for the clicked image. A Label can be added to the image by typing in the **New Label** textbox and clicking the **+** button. the labels attached to a given image are show at the button of the panel and can be removed by clicking the **x** button next to a particular label.

All labels used on the image collection can be viewed in the **Annotation Labels** dropdown. Using the arrows next to the labels, and the **Select All Labels** or **Deselect All Labels** button, single or multiple labels can be selected (denoted by a **Green** arrow). Only images that have all the selected labels will be shown.

## Search

Images can be searched for using any image characteristic or label. Clicking the **Search Category** dropdown will allow you to select an image characteristic or label to search. Clicking the **...** textbox you can type a search term or select from suggested search terms. Clicking the **Search** button will apply the search.
