# Adding Users

Tip: In order for users (team members or collaborators) to access the system, they must be invited to the platform and assigned to projects amd images.

## User categories

In gliff.ai we have 3 user categories that define the level of access and control that a user has.
These are: *Team Owners, Team Members* and *Collaborators*.

Team Owners have full access and control.

Team Members cannot see or update billing, but can:

- Create, delete and modify projects
- Upload new data
- Create annotations
- See a project audit (plan dependent)

Collaborators can only create annotations on images assigned to them, so these slots are useful for domain experts with specific knowledge that is useful for image analysis or machine learning.

## Invite Users

To invite a *Team Member* or *Collaborator*, go to **Manage** and click the **Team** button or the **Collaborators** button to access the respective management pages.

Tip: Ensure that you are on the right management page before inviting someone to join that user category.

On each page is list of access and control for the user category as above.
To invite someone to the platform, type their email address into the **invites** section and click the **Send** arrow.
They should then receive an invite email with a link for them to sign up with. If they need any help, point them to the [Account Setup](/setup) page of this guide.
