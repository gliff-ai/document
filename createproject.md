# Create a project

Tip: In order to begin uploading data and annotating images, you must first create a project as described below.

![Project Management Page](/assets/images/manage/manage_projects.png)

Click the **Projects** button to access the project management page.
To create a new project, click **+ Create New Project**.
A pop-up will appear where you can then give the project a name and assign team members already on the system to that project.
Please note: the number of projects you can create is limited by your account plan.

A project can be opened either to the Curate interface, by clicking the **Open X in Curate** button, or to the Audit interface, by clicking the **Open X in Audit** button.
